# Personal Portfolio

## Introduction
This personal portfolio is a modern, responsive web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. Built using React, it integrates a seamless user interface with dynamic data fetching and storage. Currently, the portfolio utilizes MockAPI for data storage and retrieval. Future upgrades aim to incorporate Firebase to enhance functionality and scalability.
